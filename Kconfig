            Use a built-in custom ring buffer implementation (recommended).

        help
            The pixel data is delivered to the ring buffer in whole blocks.
            - Larger block size improves data transmission efficiency; However,
            if the computation is costly, the risk of frame underflow increases.
            - Smaller block size reduces the latency to complete a whole block;
            But the processing overhead is higher than larger blocks.

            Note that since the free space in FIFO during frame transmission is
            around 9 pixels, block size of 8, 7, 6, 5 are generally *not* good
            choices, because they will leave the FIFO under-utilized, and hence
            increase interrupt frequency.

                Translucent pixels are blended directly with the background.
                This option produces the best visual. But it may not be able to support
                certain filtering operations that might be added in the future.

                This option is the slowest, but it preserves 10-bit color info which reduces
                rounding errors during blending, and hence produces less visual defects.

                Translucent pixels are pre-multiplied, then blended with the background.
                This option is faster than 10-bit pre-multiplied, but it will produce a lot
                more rounding errors, thus visual defects, especially at low opacity values.

            Use optimized blending algorithm (recommended).
            It avoids using divisions, so would run faster than the standard algorithm.
